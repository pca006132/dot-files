# PCA's Configuration Files
This repo contains configuration for [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) and [Home Manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager).

If you don't know what are they, you really should check them out.

I am new to both systems, so there may be problems in the configuration.

* `configuration.nix`: System configuration for NixOS.
* `home.nix`: home manager configuration.
