# PCA's Configuration Files
This repo contains configuration for [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) and [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/).

If you don't know what are they, you really should check them out.

I am new to both systems, so there may be problems in the configuration.

* `configuration.nix`: System configuration for NixOS.
* `config.nix`: User level package configuration, for setting up development environment.
* `doom`: Contains the configuration files for doom emacs.
